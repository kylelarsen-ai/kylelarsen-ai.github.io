    <p>My two biggest dilemmas when making this python text adventure came when I was trying to figure out why even though I printed messages that were meant to be seen after the ending they weren't showing up. I solved this problem by printing the statements before the program ended and setting a 3-second timer so the user would have a chance to read them. If I didn't add the 3-second wait timer users wouldn't have a chance to read my messages before the game clears itself for the "Game Over" screen. Another thing I did that started out small but caused me huge issues is that I was using if and else statements over and over again instead of elif statements. After I cleaned up the else if statements and replaced them with elifs it made a huge difference in how fact my code ran and how easy it was to read. Having a bunch of if else statements made my code really hard to read and became a chain reaction that caused me to make many other mistakes.
