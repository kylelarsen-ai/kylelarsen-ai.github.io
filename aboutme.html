        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="images/Headshot.JPG" width="150" height="150">
        <p>My name is Kyle Larsen, and I am a junior at Palm Desert High School. My career goal is to someday design websites for large companies. I enjoy coding quite a bit and it is one of my favorite hobbies. I also enjoy playing tabletop role-playing games such as Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, or D&D for short. My favorite thing to play as in D&D is the dungeon master who is the person in charge of creating a setting for the rest of the players to adventure in.</p>
        <p>I love how in D&D as a dungeon master I can create whatever environment I need for my players, the game has infinite potential. I am creative, open-minded, adaptable, and self-motivated, which is probably why I enjoy coding so much. Coding gives me the chance to create all sorts of new things. Website design is fun but I also want to learn more coding languages so that I can push the limits of coding as far as they can go. I see coding kinda like how I see D&D, if you know what you’re doing new worlds will open up and their limits are boundless!</p>
        <p>I think the ultimate coding project would be to make a D&D simulator where an artificially intelligent dungeon master would always be able to keep the game fun and be able to improvise new settings or cool magical items. At the moment I’m taking Computer Science classes so I can get closer to my goals. Other activities I enjoy other than coding and D&D are: playing soccer, basketball, learning about historical events, and swimming. These things all come second to playing D&D and coding but I still enjoy them a lot. Sports help me keep in shape and historical events are good conversation starters or references for D&D games which usually take place in a medieval fantasy setting.</p>
