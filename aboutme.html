        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="images/Headshot.JPG" width="150" height="150">
        <p>My name is Kyle Larsen, and I am a junior at Palm Desert High School. My career goal is to become a website design specialist and design websites for a prominent company such as Blizzard Entertainment. I enjoy coding quite a bit and it is one of my favorite hobbies which is why I would like to make a living designing websites. I think coding is amazing because of all the freedom you have when doing it and the endless possibilities. At the moment I am familiarizing myself with the CSS, JavaScript, and HTML coding languages.</p>
        <p>I think being a website design specialist would benefit my creative personality. Practicing web design also helps me quench my thirst for knowledge because there is always something new to learn when it comes to coding. I also enjoy cooperating with people on larger projects although I have no trouble working alone either. In group projects, I tend to find myself taking the lead as well as double-checking any work that has been done. I also make sure to establish organization at the beginning of whatever project I work on because I have noticed that if organization is not established early in group projects the project will soon become a mess.</p>
        <p>So far on my journey to becoming a web designer I have created my own website and taken a computer science course. If becoming a web designer does not work out I can always fall back on working in something like computer hardware manufacturing, however, it would be too soon to give up already. I have barely even started my journey and I am already quickly becoming familiar with three coding languages that I have known little to nothing about up until now, but despite that, I have already managed to use them to create a website! Wow, you made it to the end, maybe you do not consider it too impressive to have made it this far but the average person has an attention span of eight seconds and would take over a minute to make it this far into the reading. I commend you for being above average and thank you so much for taking the time to read all this. Please enjoy the rest of my website.</p>
